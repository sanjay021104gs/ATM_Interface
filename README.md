# ATM_Interface ( TASK 3 ) 

## Description:
The ATM Interface project, developed during my internship at Codsoft, simulates an ATM machine's functionalities. It provides options for withdrawing, depositing, and checking the account balance.

## Features:
- **User Interface:** Design that includes options for withdrawing, depositing, and checking the balance.
- **Function Implementation:** Methods like `withdraw(amount)`, `deposit(amount)`, and `checkBalance()` are implemented.
- **Bank Account Representation:** A class representing the user's bank account, storing the account balance.
- **Integration:** Connects the ATM class with the user's bank account class to access and modify the balance.
- **Input Validation:** Validates user input to ensure it meets acceptable limits (e.g., sufficient balance for withdrawals).
- **User Feedback:** Displays appropriate messages based on user-selected options and the success or failure of transactions.
